# The Complete Node JS Course

Learn Node.js by building real-world applications with Node, Express, MongoDB, Mocha, and more

This course was just completely refilmed to give you everything you need to master Node.js in 2019!

The entire course is based around a single goal: _Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications._

## The best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.

From the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to reinforce what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you’re done.

You’ll be building four projects:

1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet
2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs
3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication
4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion

By the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.
