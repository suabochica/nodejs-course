# Section Intro: Real-Time Web Applications with Socket.io

## 1: Section Intro: Real-Time Web Applications with Socket.io
Time to learn how to create real-time web applications with Node. The non- blocking nature of Node makes it well-suited for real-time applications such as chat apps, social media apps, and more.

## 2: Creating the Chat App Project
In this lesson itâ€™s on you to set up the chat application web server.

The goal is to give you experience using what was covered in previous lessons. (You can check the web server project as guidance)

## 3. Web Sockets
The web socket protocol is used to create real time applications. Keep in mind that you can use web sockets with other programming languages as well. But in this case we will use the protocol with NodeJS to create a chat application.

Similar to HTTP, web socket protocol is going to allow us to setup communication between server and clients. So, the server start the application and from here clients will can connect with the server. I might have one client connect, or I might have several clients as well. In the next image you will see a scenario of one server and four clients with a list of the features that the web socket protocol offers us:

The first feature able with the web socket protocol is the **full duplex communication**. It is a fancy term for bi directional communication which means, that the client can initiate communication with the server and the server can initiate with the client. This is something that the HTTP protocol had not, because there the client is the only one who can initiate the communication, then the server responds. The server could not send data to the client if the client did not make a HTTP request before.

The second detail is that **web socket protocol is separate protocol from HTTP**. This means that the web socket protocol have different behaviors than HTTP.

The last feature is that we have **persistent connection** which means that all the clients connect to the server, and stays it connected for as long as it needs to.

To conclude this lesson, less show an example of a chat application in the next image:

In this case we start with a client active, and three clients in hold. First, we're going from client to the server and we're sending a new message across. So this particular user has typed something in the input field they've clicked the submit button to post the message to the chat room and that message goes from the client to the server. Now when the server gets the message it could do nothing. It could just print it to the terminal or do something else like dump it to a file on the file system. But what we really want to do is bring our other three clients into the mix. So the client has sent a message to the server.

The next thing we're gonna do is make sure that everyone else connected to that chatroom actually sees the message that this person typed. So right here we'll go ahead and bring those three clients into the mix. And this time we're also going to send some data around this time though it's going to go from the server to the client something we were not able to do in the past. So right here the server has said to this client I have a message from another user. It's going to send that message across to the client and the client can it in the browser the exact same thing is going to happen with our other two clients as well.
