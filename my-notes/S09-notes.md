## 1. Intro: Application Deployment
Time to learn how to set up communication between the client and the server. This will be done via HTTP request. The goal is that users will be able to type an address in the browser to view their forecast.

## 2. Joining Heroku and Github
You will join to Github and Heroku. Github is a development platform that makes it easy to manage software development projects. Heroku is an application deployment platform which provides everything needed to deploy your Node.js applications.

### Joining to Heroku
Make sure to sign up for an account with both, Github and Heroku. From there, install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). After running the installer, you can confirm the Heroku CLI was installed correctly by running `heroku -v` to print the installed version.

The Heroku CLI give you commands to deploy and manage you Node.js applications. Before you can do that, you will need to log in to your Heroku account. This makes sure that the command you run actually changes your Heroku applications.

```
heroku login
```
